Preparing for the job search process takes time and cannot be completed in just a few weeks. You obviously can, but this can lead to wasted time, and this can lead to added frustration and imposter syndrome. 

Proper planning is vital in any new endeavor, and this ‘endeavor’ is one of the most important you will experience. Everyone’s path will be a little different, so let’s first focus on goals and evaluating our skills.

**Complete these three activities and share your answers with your weekly team meeting.**

***

#### Activity 1

Think about your strengths and weaknesses from both a technical and non-technical perspective.

* How comfortable are you:
  * Building a basic front-end design in React?
  * Building a CRUD API in Node/Express?
  * Would these tasks give you anxiety and stress if you had to do it without being able to research and/or look at examples? Or it was timed?
* Do you have the ability to talk professionally about yourself?
  * Can you summarize in 60 seconds or less your dev experiences and journey (your pitch)?
  * Can you highlight your top 3 skills?
  * Besides your technical skills, what other skills (leadership, communication, mentorship, etc) do you feel you excel at and/or enjoy?
* How are you in communicating technical topics that others can understand?
  * Could you describe how React and React Router work to a non-technical person? OR describing how a REST API and routes work?
  * How would you explain the feature(s) you worked on in your team that you are most proud of?
  * How confident are you in JavaScript (or other languages) technical questions focusing on explaining callbacks, closures, scope, event loop, etc.?

#### Activity 2

Before you can start thinking about applying for jobs, think about these first:

1. What role(s) do I want to apply for? 
   1. What excites me?  Design? Solving problems? API? Leading a team?
   1. Think about your learning in classes and practicum try to focus on what you enjoyed. 
   1. Research what roles would best fit your “passion”.
   1. Find a few job descriptions that fit the role(s) you are looking for and see what skills you have and need.
1. What types of organizations would best fit your needs and goals?
   1. Tech? Diversity? Giving back to the community? 
   1. Find 5-10 companies (not focusing on hiring roles) that best fit the type of company you would like to work at.

#### Activity 3

Start putting together your resume! 

* Pick a resume template that you like.
  * Don't overthink this! For how your resume looks, it's most important that the reader (and ATS) can find information quickly, not how "beautiful" or "unique" it is.
* Start filling in what you can.
  * Start with the easy stuff, like contact info, project titles, work experience positions and company names, your main skills, etc. 
  * Feel free to skip the harder sections for now. Your goal is to get a resume _draft_ ready, not achieve perfection.
* Add a brief description of each project and work experience.
  * We will work on polishing them more next week!
